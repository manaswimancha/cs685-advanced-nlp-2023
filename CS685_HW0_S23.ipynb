        "Choose  one  paper  from  [EMNLP 2022](https://aclanthology.org/volumes/2022.emnlp-main/) that you find interesting. A good way to do this is by scanning the titles and abstracts; there are hundreds of papers so take your time before selecting one!  Then, write a summary in  your own words of the paper you chose. Your summary should answer the following questions: what is its motivation? Why should anyone care about it? Were there things in the paper that you didn't understand at all? What were they? Fill out the below cell, and make sure to write 2-4 paragraphs for the summary to receive full credit!"

A new approach of balanced adversarial training can make models robust to both fickle and obstinate adversarial examples. Yes. I did not understand distance-oracle misalignment and GLUE evaluation."
